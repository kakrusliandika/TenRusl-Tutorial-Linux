# 🔐 08 Admin Zone

    ## Objective
    Restrict the Nginx UI administrative surface so management traffic is separated from public hosting traffic.

    ## Prerequisites
    - SSH access independent of the panel.
    - A maintenance window or staging path for risky changes.

    ## Environment Assumptions
    - Nginx UI installation method matters. Some deployments run it as a native service, others in containers. Keep the web server and panel state discoverable from the shell before relying on the UI.
    - The panel is not the only source of truth about the host.

    ## Sequential Steps
    ### 1. Perform the stage-specific panel task
    - Record what changed in the UI and what should change on the host.

    ### 2. Inspect shell-visible state immediately
    ```bash
ss -ltnp | grep -Ei "panel|bt|clp|nginx-ui|8443|8888|7800" || true
curl -Ik https://admin.example.com 2>/dev/null || true
```

    ### 3. Save inventory notes for the next operator
    - Hostname or domain
    - Site root or service mapping
    - Runtime or database dependency
    - Backup and rollback impact

    ## ✅ Validation Checkpoints
    - The panel intent matches shell-visible state.
    - Listener, runtime, and logs stay understandable.

    ## ⚠️ Warnings
    - Do not trust panel convenience more than shell verification.

    ## Cleanup / Post-Check
    - Save the resulting inventory snapshot with the host notes.
